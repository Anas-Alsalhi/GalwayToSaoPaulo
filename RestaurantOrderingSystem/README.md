## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Restaurant Ordering System

The Restaurant Ordering System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the operations of a restaurant. It provides features for managing menus, processing customer orders, booking events, and maintaining order history.
